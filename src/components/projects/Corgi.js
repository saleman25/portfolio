            Remember TamaGotchis? Ever wanted to own a corgi? 
            Well now you can have the best of both worlds! My project is inspired by TamaGotchis and my corgi Anakin. 
            You can adopt your own happy corgi and play with them until they grow up and have to leave to the big city 
            to provide for the family!
